# 🎵 Musical Structure App: Ever Green Music App  

This app was developed as part of the **Android Basics: Multi-Screen Apps** course, a module in the **Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree** program.

## 📌 Project Overview  

The goal was to design and layout the flow for the structure of a **Music Player app**, making the structure of a music app using **Intents, New Activities, ArrayLists, Loops, and Custom Classes**.
